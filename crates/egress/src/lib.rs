//! Outbound safety: which destinations RunLater may call, which headers a caller may set,
//! and how each delivery is signed.
//!
//! This crate checks URL *syntax* only. Workers cannot resolve DNS before `fetch`, so the
//! address-level guarantee (no private, loopback or reserved IPs, including via DNS) comes
//! from the API Worker's `global_fetch_strictly_public` compatibility flag. Both checks run
//! on every attempt, not just when a task is accepted.
