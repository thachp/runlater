//! Pure task domain: request validation, the task lifecycle, retry policy and limits.
//!
//! No Cloudflare dependencies, so everything here is tested natively with `cargo test`.
//! Time is always passed in as unix milliseconds; nothing here reads a clock or a RNG.
//! The API stores tasks as rows and drives them through [`Task`]'s transitions.
